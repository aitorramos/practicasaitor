00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.000
Every grandfather that dies

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.000
leaves with him a glace

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:12.000

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:13.000
his own story.

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:15.000
When my mother died

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:18.000
she took pictures of me that nobody buther has ever possessed

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:21.000
me in the cradle, me with the feeding bottle, me playing with my brothers

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:25.000
the garden, the house, my father

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:26.000
her grandmother, her mother.

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.000
that disappeared with her.

00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:32.000
What she took, no-one ever will see it again
